# MintClassics Warehouse Optimization – SQL Case Study

Author: Harshika 

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and improving warehouse operations for MintClassics, a global retailer of collectible cars and accessories. Using SQL as the primary tool, the goal was to explore their order and inventory data to generate actionable insights that could support smarter inventory planning, regional performance tracking, and operational decision-making.

The analysis was structured in five stages, beginning with data exploration and ending in business recommendations backed by query results.

## Business Problem

MintClassics has been experiencing challenges around stock availability, regional warehouse inefficiencies, and unclear product demand patterns. The key objectives were:

- Identify high-demand and low-demand products
- Analyze office-level sales performance across regions
- Understand sales rep effectiveness
- Recommend warehouse improvements based on real usage data

By answering these questions, the project aims to support better warehouse layout planning, inventory allocation, and overall efficiency.
