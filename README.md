# MintClassics Warehouse Optimization – SQL Case Study

**Author:** Harshika

## About the Project

This SQL case study analyzes operational data from MintClassics, a global classic car retailer. The goal was to identify patterns in product demand, office-level performance, and inventory movement to support warehouse optimization.

The analysis was done using pure SQL across five structured parts: data exploration, product performance, regional sales, sales rep analysis, and product line insights.

## Business Objective

MintClassics needed better visibility into:
- Which products and regions drive the most revenue
- How sales reps and offices contribute to performance
- Which SKUs to prioritize or phase out

This project uses SQL to help answer those questions and support data-driven decision-making for inventory and fulfillment.
